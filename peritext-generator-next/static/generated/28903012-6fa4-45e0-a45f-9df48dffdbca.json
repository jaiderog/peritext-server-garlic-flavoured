The only boy in the class, and a creative overachiever, C.J. insisted on picking out new fabrics and patterns before the actual training started.

He doesn’t play football or like trucks and guns. He prefers Barbies and the color pink, so much so that when he was 3 years old, Lori had his vision tested to determine if he could even see the color blue. C.J. is gender nonconforming, meaning he very much considers himself a boy but doesn’t exist within the typical confines placed on youthful masculinity. Needless to say, for Matt, raising C.J. has been a departure from the life he lived as a boy, in a home where even his mom was a “tomboy.” Parenthood pivoted Matt’s journey from that of a former college football player and Orange County cop to that of a reluctant activist, rallying for his son’s right to freely express himself while facing one hell of a learning curve.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":126,"length":117,"key":2}],"data":{}},{"key":"dvudi","text":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*GD-9BT-efbsl1NE3ngJqCw.png","type":"atomic","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":69,"key":3}],"data":{}},{"key":"elg69","text":"My wife and I have been married for 17 years.

Chase would ask to check out the toys and take C.J. with him, only to lose his younger brother to the all-pink Barbie aisle until it was time to leave.

I told Lori we were going to raise C.J. the same way we raised Chase — instilling the same values and virtues — but that we would follow his lead and love him no matter what.

We did go through periods of depriving him of Barbies and toys like that, thinking if we didn’t allow him to play with that stuff, he would get into more masculine toys. But C.J. was unhappy. That’s been part of the reason why we’ve been so open about our experiences raising him — we wanted to create a conversation that wasn’t about changing who your child is, but that offered practical advice to parents raising gender-creative children.

I hate, though, putting labels on things, especially kids. Childhood is all about growth and fluidity. Our son might be 10 years old now and using terms like gender creative, but when he’s 13 or 14 years old, he might be using terms like, “I’m gay, and I like men.” That’s an issue we’ve had to struggle with — being able to respect him for who he is without letting our attempts to understand him limit who he tells us he is.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"am8q8","text":"To that end, C.J. has always been the best at explaining who he is.

If you look at the statistics, most parents with gender-variant children get divorced. Oftentimes, the trouble is that one parent supports the child’s gender expression and the other doesn’t.
