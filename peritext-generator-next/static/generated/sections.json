The big holdout had been Coinbase, the most popular online exchange, which had stated it would not support BCH — until announcing it will add support by 2018. For those worried about how the fork would affect Bitcoin’s market value, after a brief dip following the split, Bitcoin rebounded to set a new record. After breaking the $3,000-per-Bitcoin threshold, the original cryptocurrency has hovered around $3,300-$3,400 this week.
