This paradoxical relation to the laws of scholarly communication may be enlightened by a closer look to the relation of formats to normativity. When used in a context of design and planification for the production of textual forms, formats are indeed the name of a prescription. They define a priori the need for specific production setups, transportation & storage facilities, display setups in libraries and bookstores, intended markets and targeted audiences, and even scenarii of use and day-by-day practices. However this prescription never directly preempt contents, meaning or experiences. It is a conditional prescription which “sets conditions” rather than “give instructions”, and this explains why when inspected in the context of a sociology of textual uses, however, formats are also normative agents in the sense that they produce a posteriori a conventional frame for the interpretation of texts and the formation of publics, which can never be totally put under the control of the prescriptive choices associated with formats. There is therefore a dynamicity of formats,  as this normativity a posteriori retroactively operates on the normativity to be imposed to formats to come. Because of its dynamic qualities, the law instaured by formats always contains from the very time of its formulation the conditions of their own transgression, its intrinsic “principle of contamination”, as coined by Derrida about the paradoxes of genre classification. Therefore the instantiation of formats normativity is as well the registration of a jurisprudence as the application of a doctrine, as confirms Michel Serres’ definition of format as “the making of a law from repetition”  .","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":256,"length":8,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":446,"length":4,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":704,"length":8,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1258,"length":13,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1521,"length":12,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":1964,"length":14,"style":"ITALIC"},{"offset":2002,"length":9,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":76,"length":1,"key":4},{"offset":2101,"length":1,"key":5}],"data":{}},{"key":"c76mn","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"6kijc","text":"I will then talk about  .","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":23,"length":1,"key":6}],"data":{}},{"key":"fjs23","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"d9not","text":"This is not working very well why is that ?

Within the field of biology  , specification describes at the same time how a species gets discriminated from a broader genre, and how an individual gets determined and described through - non-exclusive - properties. This chapter has shown how scholarly formats are both the outcome of a specification process by which socio-cultural and technical processes stabilize material-discursive forms, and the agents of the specification of scholarly production, reading and writing processes, as they instaure frames, institutions and infrastructures for these practices. Therefore, naming the format of a document is a performative operation which connects material and formal specificities with discursive practices in a co-dependent way, as it instantiates the specifications embedded in that name at the same time it constitutes them through their specific and local instantiations.

According to the third sense - specification as prescription - making formats is also a deliberate and constitutive act for the formation of scholarly worlds.  If one acknowledges that the specification operated by formats is performative and contributes on its own terms to knowledge production, researching with scholarly formats turns to be a critical and genuinely scholarly endeavour. For instance, calling “scholarly book” a textual instance which does not correlates with what one thinks of scholarly books is an act of specification in three ways: (1) it suggests to read what’s attached to this name as a scholarly book - whatever the “instruction manual” embedded in that name would read for different individuals, based on their experience and mindset. (2) it adds a supplementary trait to a specific text as something which is, among other things, a scholarly book, and thus attach this specific text to a broader group, calling for intertextual interpretation. (3) it distinguishes this instance as a “scholarly book” from other texts that belong to a different category like, say, “literature books” or “books” in general. This operation reconfigures boundaries and territories between these different formats, and questions specific features and values that make the “horizon of expectation” of this format among others. Each of these operations make the format of a specific “scholarly book” a constitutive and critical gesture towards what is a scholarly book. As formats orient as much as they can be oriented, contemporary experiments in scholarly formats are always a subtle equilibrium game between orientation and disorientation. This equilibrium is found through an appropriate level of displacement between discourse and     : developing too displaced material properties for a text makes the quest for a format’s name painful and disorienting and incidentally invites actors to sail to safer territories, while using scholarly formats without any attention to their agency provokes the risk of a formatted scholarly practice, where the overload of orientation tends to formalize intellectual work by reducing it to the recognition of certain formal features validating authenticity and guiding the production of knowledge.
